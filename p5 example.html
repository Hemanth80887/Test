        <h1 class="h2"; style="margin: 0;"><b><i><u>Introduction</u></i></b></h1>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Black Lives Matter (BLM)</b>, <b><u>international social movement</u></b>, formed in the<u><b> United States</b></u> in 2013, dedicated to <u><b>fighting racism and anti-Black violence</b></u>, especially in the form of <u><b>police brutality</b></u>. The name Black Lives Matter signals condemnation of the <u><b>unjust killings</b></u> of Black people by police (Black people are far more likely to be killed by police in the United States than white people) and the demand that society value the lives and humanity of Black people as much as it values the lives and humanity of white people <br> <br>BLM activists have held large and influential protests in cities across the United States as well as internationally. A decentralized grassroots movement, Black Lives Matter is led by activists in local chapters who organize their own campaigns and programs. The chapters are <abbr title="">affiliated</abbr> with the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, a nonprofit civil rights organization that is active in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom..</p>

        <h1 class="h3"; style="margin: 0;"><b><u><i>Early history: Trayvon Martin shooting</i></u></b></h1>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            BLM was cofounded in 2013 as an online movement (using the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media) by three Black community organizers‚Äî <b><u>Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi</u></b>. They formed BLM after <b><u>George Zimmerman</u></b>, a man of German and Peruvian descent, was acquitted on charges stemming from his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, had seen Martin walking in his neighborhood and called the police because he thought Martin looked <abbr title="">‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù</abbr>. Although Zimmerman was told not to do anything, he followed Martin, got into an argument with him, and shot and killed him. When law enforcement arrived, Zimmerman claimed that he had been assaulted by Martin and fired in self-defense.<br><br>Zimmerman remained free for weeks, but, as the shooting gained national attention, demonstrations demanding his prosecution were held in cities across the United States. He was finally charged with second-degree murder and arrested in April 2012. At his trial more than a year later, Zimmerman claimed that he had acted in self-defense, citing a controversial Florida law known as <b><u><i>‚Äústand your ground.‚Äù</i></u></b> His acquittal in July 2013 was widely perceived as a miscarriage of justice and led to further nationwide protests.

        <h1 class="h4"; style="margin: 0;"><b><u><i>BLM mission</i></u></b></h1>
        <p style="margin: 0;">The Black Lives Matter movement has many goals. BLM activists seek to draw attention to the many ways in which Black people are treated unfairly in society and the ways in which institutions, laws, and policies help to perpetuate that unfairness. The movement has fought<b><u> racism</u></b> through such means as political action, letter-writing campaigns, and nonviolent protests. BLM seeks to combat police brutality, the over-policing of minority neighborhoods, and the abuses committed by for-profit jails.<br><br> Its efforts have included calls for better training for police and greater accountability for police misconduct. BLM activists have also called for <b><u><i>‚Äúdefunding‚Äù </i></u></b>the police‚Äîthat is, reducing police department budgets and investing the freed-up funds in community social services, such as mental health and conflict-resolution programs. BLM activists have worked on voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns in Black communities. In addition, BLM programs have celebrated Black artists and writers.</p>
